Pros of TDD:<br/>
Allows for clear testing and understanding of what each code segment should do.<br/>
Problems in count will be found easier so will save time later searching for bugs.<br/>
It is easier to alter code later on, and ensure it fits with other parts of code.<br/>
Makes collaboration easier, each unit is made clear how it should function<br/>
Creating testing as part of coding itself makes testing if it must be done later anyway.<br/>


Cons of TDD:<br/>
Requires more time to get functionality.<br/>
Requiring early on modularity does not necessarily work as well on a large scale.<br/>
Can end up being overly cautious, wasting development time.<br/>
More time is spent for each functionality, so if code is changing often, this increases the time wasted.<br/>
Can hold developers back by prioritizing ease of testing rather than efficient and smart code.<br/>
