Pros of TDD:
Allows for clear testing and understanding of what each code segment should do.
Problems in count will be found easier so will save time later searching for bugs.
It is easier to alter code later on, and ensure it fits with other parts of code.
Makes collaboration easier, each unit is made clear how it should function
Creating testing as part of coding itself makes testing if it must be done later anyway.


Cons of TDD:
Requires more time to get functionality.
Requiring early on modularity does not necessarily work as well on a large scale.
Can end up being overly cautious, wasting development time.
More time is spent for each functionality, so if code is changing often, this increases the time wasted.
Can hold developers back by prioritizing ease of testing rather than efficient and smart code.
